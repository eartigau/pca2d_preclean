"""Every run an output root holds, read from what the runs left in it.

    python -m pca2d.runs /Volumes/irrisor/pca2d_preclean/corrected

A run writes `resolved_config.yaml` into its own folder before its first
stage: every setting as it ended up, the command it was given word for word,
the code it ran, and the time it started. That file is therefore the record
of the run, and this walks an output root for them, newest first, so that
the window can list what has been tried, with what, and where each one's
compilation PDF is.

Nothing here reads a cube or a spectrum: a root of a hundred runs is read in
a fraction of a second, and a folder still being written answers with what it
has.
