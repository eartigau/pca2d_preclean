"""The LBL template and variability basis, from the star block of the fit.

The first star component, at its mean amplitude, is a high-passed template of
the star: fitted to every exposure at once, in the barycentric frame, with the
observer block already describing the atmosphere. That is what LBL's template
step spends its time estimating. Each order parity gets its own: the star block
plus that parity's weighted mean of what the fit left (star_coverage), since
LBL measures an order against the template of its parity. Written by LBL's own writer, in LBL's template
format and under the name LBL looks for, it takes the place of that step for
the corrected object, which is what makes pca2d a front end to LBL rather than
a stage in front of it.

The further star components, when the fit has any, are directions in which the
star's spectrum varies. LBL already projects every line's residual on vectors
of that kind, its RESPROJ tables: DTEMP3000 and the rest are temperature
gradients of model spectra. STRPCA2..N are the same object measured on the
star itself, and LBL reports their amplitude per exposure the way it reports
DTEMP, as a column of the rdb and its error.

FRAMES. The template is written in the barycentric frame, as LBL's own is; LBL
takes it to the star's rest frame itself, by the systemic velocity its mask
step measures (SYSTVELO in the mask header). It does not do that to a RESPROJ
table, which it evaluates as it stands, in the rest frame. So the STRPCA
vectors are written shifted by that same velocity, and can only be written
once the mask exists.

WHERE IT GOES. The template is made once per fit, beside the run's other
outputs (star_template.fits), and copied from there to where LBL looks for the
corrected object's template. A template LBL built itself is never replaced; one
of ours is, when the fit it came from has changed, and PCA2FIT in its header
(the fit's time and size) is how that is known.

    where plotting.live_mask keeps them, the rule the report's panels use;
    rows the MAD cut rejected are left out. Beside them, each parity's
    weighted mean of what the whole model leaves (the data less the star
    block, its star-frame means, the observer block and the parity offset),
    carried the same way.

    That mean is the part of the star each parity sees and the star block does
    not. Under the default --mean offset the block is one spectrum for both
    parities, while the two sample a line at different places on the order and
    so at different resolutions, and LBL measures each order against the
    template of its own parity. On TOI-2120 LBL's own template differs between

    subtracted: its mean over the exposures moves both parities by the same
