"""The velocity bias that follows BERV, fitted by MCMC against V_tot.

A telluric line blended with a stellar line pulls the velocity measured on it
by an amount that depends on how far apart the two are. That separation is
the star's velocity in the telluric frame, the systemic velocity less the
BERV:

    V_tot = vrad / 1000 - BERV        (km/s; vrad from LBL in m/s)

and not the BERV alone, which is V_tot only for a star at rest (asked for on
2026-09-16: on SMETHELLS_20, at +2.6 km/s, it hardly matters; a star at
+-30 km/s may never bring its lines onto the tellurics at all). Superposed,
V_tot = 0, the blend is symmetric and nothing moves; far apart, nothing is
blended; in between, the pull is the derivative of a Gaussian:

    v(V_tot) = c + amp * V_tot * exp(-0.5 * (V_tot / sigma)**2)

odd in V_tot, zero at 0, extreme at V_tot = +-sigma, where it is worth

    peak = amp * sigma * exp(-1/2)

The width is fitted and quoted as the FWHM of that Gaussian, 2 sqrt(2 ln 2)
sigma, the number a blend of two lines has a known value for.

(written `amp*np.exp(-0.5*BERV/sigma)*BERV` when it was asked for, on
2026-09-16: the square is what makes the bias die away on both sides; taken
as written it grows without bound on one side). A straight line against
BERV, which the report drew before, has no such shape and no meaning here.
The functions below take V_tot, from `total_velocity`, wherever they say
`berv`: the shape is the same whatever the axis is called.

`amp` is signed, and the fit explores both signs: its prior is symmetric and
half the walkers start on each side. `amp` and `fwhm` are what the fit is
for; `c`, the velocities' arbitrary
zero, and `jitter`, the scatter LBL's error bars do not account for, are
fitted beside them and marginalised. Without the jitter the posterior would be
as narrow as LBL's error bars are optimistic: 13 m/s against 44 m/s of scatter
on SMETHELLS_20. The sampler is Goodman and Weare's affine-invariant stretch
move, emcee's algorithm, in a few lines of numpy: emcee is not in the
pipeline's environment, and four parameters do not need it.

    amp       uniform within +-1e4 (m/s)/(km/s), signed, since a bias pulls
              either way. A flat prior, asked for on 2026-09-16 in place of
              the modified Jeffreys 1/(|amp| + a0) it had until then: the
              Jeffreys one favours small amplitudes, and so the narrow widths
              whose bias would need a large one. On SMETHELLS_20 the delivered
              bias barely moves (-68.7 to -70.9 m/s, 7.0 to 7.2 sigma) and the
              corrected upper limit rises from 24.9 to 33.6 m/s (32.3 to 33.6
              over three seeds, 33.0 on a chain of 12 000 steps): what the
              data say, without the prior's pull toward zero
    fwhm      Gaussian, 5 +- 1.5 km/s, within 1 to 10 km/s (asked for on
              2026-09-17: the width of the Gaussian whose derivative the
              bias is, the blend of a stellar and a telluric line at a
              resolution of 70 000 to 80 000, is known to that precision).
              It replaced a log-uniform sigma over 1 to 60 km/s, which let a
              bias that is not there hide in the narrowest widths with a
              large amplitude, and let a slow drift of the velocities pass
              for a bias tens of km/s wide (GL725B: sigma 33 km/s)
    c         uniform, m/s: the DC level, the velocity far from the tellurics,
              which is not the median when the exposures sit more on one side
              of V_tot = 0 than the other
    slope     uniform within +-1e3 m/s per year: the DC level's drift over
              the campaign, c + slope * (t - t_mid), when the times are given
              (asked for on 2026-09-17). V_tot follows the season, and on a
              star whose V_tot spans a few km/s a drift of the velocities
              passes for a bias: GL725B corrected, Delta BIC +8.4 with the
              DC level held constant, -5.2 with it drifting
    jitter    log-uniform over 1e-3 to 1e4 m/s
