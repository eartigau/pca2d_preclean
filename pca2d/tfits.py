"""Reading APERO `t.fits` spectra: one row per diffraction order.

Layout of a NIRPS t.fits (APERO 0.7.x, the file LBL is fed):

    PRIMARY       ESO + APERO header, no data
    FluxA         (75, 4088)  telluric-CORRECTED extracted flux, blaze still in
    WaveA         (75, 4088)  wavelength solution, nm, OBSERVER frame
    BlazeA        (75, 4088)  blaze
    Recon         (75, 4088)  the telluric transmission that was divided out
    SKYCORR_SCI   (75, 4088)  sky model, not used here
    SKYCORR_CAL   (75, 4088)  sky model, not used here

Three things about this format drive everything below.

1. There is no single wavelength grid. Each order carries its own solution, and
   consecutive orders overlap by 2-5 nm, so part of the spectrum is measured
   twice at two different samplings. Orders n and n+2, on the other hand, never
   overlap (measured: the gap runs from 4 to 22 nm across the array). So the
   whole echellogram collapses onto exactly two non-redundant spectra on a
   common grid -- the even orders and the odd orders -- and that is what we
   build. Two rows per exposure instead of 75, with nothing thrown away.

2. The sampling is not uniform in velocity: within an order the step drifts, and
   between orders it jumps. Anything with a fixed pixel width -- the high-pass,
   above all -- has to be applied *after* resampling onto the log-uniform
   destination grid, never on the native pixels.

3. BERV, BJD and the per-order extraction SNR live in the FluxA header, not in
   PRIMARY. The observing conditions (airmass, humidity) live in PRIMARY. Both
   have to be consulted.
