"""A run's report as a document: LaTeX, a table of contents, sections, numbers.

    python -m pca2d.texreport --run <run folder>       # write it again, now
    python -m pca2d.texreport --run <run folder> --lbl-dir <LBL tree>

The report a run left was the figures it drew, bound one after another with a
page of monospace text in front: a compilation of matplotlib outputs, which is
what it looked like (2026-09-16). This writes a report instead, from
templates/report.tex:

    abstract          what was run and what it did to the velocities, in words
    lists             the contents, and every figure by a short name
    1 Summary         the gains and losses of every star, one table each,
                      every row saying which way it went
    2 Velocities      per star: the time series (points, no lines), the same
                      points against BERV, d2v as an activity indicator, what
                      the correction changed, and the periodograms
    3 The run         every setting, the command, the code, the fit's numbers
    4 The correction  the figures of the figures stage, each with a caption
    5 Not drawn       what did not build, and why
    A Parameters      the resolved configuration, verbatim

It is written twice in a run's life: at the figures stage, when there are no
velocities yet, and after LBL, when there are. Both times from what is on disk:
the figures the figures stage keeps in <run>/report/figures, listed in
<run>/report/manifest.json, and LBL's rdb files. A run from before the report
existed has neither folder nor manifest; its bound PDF is cut along its own
bookmarks instead, so `--run` works on it too.

Nothing here is fatal to a run. Without pdflatex, or when it fails, the bound
PDF the figures stage wrote stays the report and the run says why.
