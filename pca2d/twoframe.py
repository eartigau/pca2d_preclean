"""Two-frame (star + observer) weighted PCA, by block coordinate descent.

The `fit` stage of `pca2d-preclean`. The blocks are updated one at a time, with
the coefficients of both solved *jointly* per spectrum, so the fit decides which
frame a feature belongs to rather than the analyst choosing a registration. The
design history is section 11 of NOTES.md in spectropca_per_obj.

    python -m pca2d.twoframe --cube cache/cube_tfits_<key> \
        --outdir outputs/<object>/<M>-<N> --config <resolved_config.yaml>
    python -m pca2d.twoframe --replot --outdir outputs/<object>/<M>-<N>

Working frame is the OBSERVER frame, so the weights (photon noise, telluric
ramp) never move. The star basis is carried into each spectrum's frame by an
exact Lanczos translation: on the log-uniform grid a Doppler shift is a
translation of atanh(v/c) / (dv/c) samples (grids.pixel_shift), and the
operator's adjoint is the same taps scattered rather than gathered (NOTES.md
11.3).

    multiplies this column is a shift in pixels and alpha * dv is a velocity in
    km/s. It is also why d/d(ln lambda) needs nothing but np.gradient: the grid
    is uniform in ln lambda by construction, which is the whole reason it was
    built that way.

    WHAT IS HANDED IN HERE IS ALWAYS A RECONSTRUCTION, the carried a.P of one

    of its noise, and at SPIRou SNR per sample that is most of what it would
    be. The column would then be noise, alpha would fit noise against noise,
    and the term would inject exactly the velocity error it exists to prevent.

    it, which is how the shift is estimated from clean stellar lines only: the
    columns inside a photometric band whose telluric transmission stays high
    across the campaign. Estimating it anywhere else means fitting the star's

    is least trustworthy, and it showed: against LBL the unmasked term came out
    1.8 times too large.

    B_n = [ S_n P^T , Q^T ] is M x (K+J); the off-diagonal blocks of
    B_n^T W_n B_n are the cross-frame overlaps and are the whole point.

    With `exposure` given, the rows sharing an id are solved as ONE measurement.
    For a t.fits cube those rows are the even and the odd orders of a single
    exposure: one spectrum, of one star, at one instant, split across the
    detector. It has one coefficient vector, and this is how that is imposed.

    THE CONSTRAINT. Per row r the normal equations are

        (B_r^T W_r B_r) c = B_r^T W_r y_r,   B_r = [ S_r P^T | Q^T ]

    with W_r the diagonal weights of that row. Rather than solving that twice
    per exposure, the two systems are SUMMED and solved once,

        (sum_r B_r^T W_r B_r) c_n = sum_r B_r^T W_r y_r

    and the single c_n is written back to both rows.

    WHY THAT IS EXACT, not an approximation. B_r depends on the row only through
    S_r, and S_r depends only on the BERV. Both rows are the same exposure, so
    they carry the same BERV to machine precision and B_even = B_odd. The two
    systems therefore differ only through their weights, which say which columns
    each parity covers, and those supports are disjoint outside the order
    overlaps. Summing them is then exactly the normal equation of the single
    least-squares problem in which every sample of the exposure, from either
    parity, constrains one coefficient vector. The sum reassembles the exposure;
    it does not average two estimates of it.

    NOTE what is and is not per parity. The components are not: P and Q are
    single vectors over the whole grid, and there is no such thing as an even
    component or an odd one. Only the means are per parity, both of them with
    --mean iterate, the star's and the observer's: the two parities see the
    same lines at different resolutions, a static property of the instrument,
    and only the weights know which columns a row covers.

    THE VELOCITY COLUMN. With `velocity_from` given the design gains one more
    column per spectrum, the derivative of the star model those coefficients
    describe, carried into this exposure's frame. It is there to keep a
    velocity OUT of the observer block.

    The star is never exactly where the BERV alone would put it: it has its own
    motion, the planet and the activity, and the carry operator leaves a
    residual of its own. Whatever the cause, that residual has one shape, f',
    and the observer block has seven free vectors and an amplitude per exposure
    with which to describe it. It does. Dividing that block out of the flux
    then moves the star's lines, which is a velocity written into the corrected
    spectrum by the correction itself; measured on TOI2120 it accounts for 41%
    of the variance of what the correction changed in LBL's velocities. And
    when the star has a real signal, the observer block absorbs the planet and
    the correction subtracts it: the thing being looked for, removed by the
    tool meant to clear the way to it.

    So the shift gets a name and a column of its own. It is FITTED and it is
    never divided out. The term exists to keep the velocity out of Q, not to
    take it out of the data; taking it out of the data would erase exactly the
    signal the pipeline is for.

    Tied by exposure like everything else here, because a velocity is a
    property of the exposure and not of a detector parity.

    With `star_mean` = (T, group), the derivative is of T_g + a_n P, the whole
    star: with --mean iterate the star's static part lives in its per-parity
    mean and the components hold only its variations, so a derivative of the
    components alone would be the derivative of almost nothing.

    `live` is the STAR frame's support, star_support. Until 2026-09-10 it was
    taken as w.sum(axis=0) > 0, which on an observer-frame cube is the
    observer frame's support: an OH core masked in every exposure is a hole
    there and never one in the star frame, where the exposures at other BERVs
    see it. The guard then cut a hole 2a wide into every row at the star
    column equal to the OH line's observer column, mstep zeroed the basis
    there, and the first column past it, just above mstep's floor, grew a
    spike: the vertical lines in the report's panels 2, 4 and 5, each touching
    an OH river at the BERV where the two frames coincide. Without `live` the
    old rule is kept, for a cube registered in the star's frame, where the two
    supports are the same.

    This is what it takes to run the two-frame model over a domain that is
    mostly holes. The M-step side is already safe: `diag_normal` reports an
    honest near-zero star-frame weight inside a gap and `mstep` floors it away,
    so the basis is simply not defined there. The *forward* side is not. The
    model at sample m is sum_t c_t P[m - base + t], t in [-a, a), so a sample
    within a of a hole edge is built partly from basis samples that were never
    constrained and are therefore zero. The model comes out too small, the fit
    sees a residual it cannot explain in the star frame, and the Earth block
    obligingly absorbs a rim of star-frame structure around every gap.

    The exact fix is to stop using those samples: a sample is admissible only if
    its whole tap window lands on constrained basis samples. Note this acts on
    the weights, never on the operator, so the forward map, its adjoint and
    `diag_normal` stay the same object -- which matters, because an operator
    that is not its own adjoint is what NOTES.md 11.9 spent a day diagnosing.

    Apodising the taps at the hole edge, or renormalising them over the live
    subset, would retain those samples instead of dropping them. It is not worth
    it here: on the 965-1950 nm NIRPS domain the holes are a few dozen wide
    blocks, so the rim is a fraction of a percent of the data, and the price
    would be a shift operator whose adjoint has to be rederived.

    `denominator > 0` is not a sufficient guard. With an honest banded operator
    the star-frame weight really does fall to ~1e-15 of nominal inside a telluric
    gap (that is the whole point of NOTES 11.3), and dividing by it puts a huge
    spike in the eigenvector: it drove cond(A) from 6 to 5e10 the first time this
    ran, and a 1e-8 floor still left max|v|/rms at 196 against 17 for the input.
    The FFT operator never tripped this only because its smearing filled the gaps
    back in with fictitious weight.

    floor_frac = 1e-2 costs essentially nothing here, because the denominator is
    strongly bimodal: constrained samples sit within a factor of ~1.3 of the
    maximum (median 6.4e4 against max 8.7e4) and only **0.11%** of samples fall
    below 1% of it. Measured counts below a given fraction of the max, out of
    38696 samples: 1e-8 -> 29, 1e-4 -> 36, 1e-2 -> 44, 1e-1 -> 46. There is no
    population in between to lose; the spikes come entirely from the handful of
    samples sitting just above whatever floor is chosen.

    The floor is a fraction of the **median** of the positive denominators, not
    of their maximum. Over the 1500-1600 nm band those two differ by a factor
    1.3 and the choice is immaterial, which is why the original spelling was
    fine. Over 965-1950 nm they do not: the per-order extraction SNR runs from
    108 to 294, so the weight alone spans a factor of seven before the telluric
    ramp and the per-column exposure count are applied, and a floor set at 1% of
    the global maximum would silently delete legitimately constrained samples at
    the blue end of Y. What the floor has to separate is real data from
    numerical residue, and residue sits at ~1e-15 of nominal; the typical
    constrained weight is the right yardstick for that, the largest one is not.

    the power divides between the star-anchored and the Earth-anchored block is
    the whole question the two-frame model exists to answer.

    Everything is quoted against `chi2_null`, the cube after the star-frame
    median template and the per-parity observer mean have been taken out. That
    is what the blocks actually fit and it is the only reference that means
    anything here: the raw pre-template variance is dominated by the stellar
    spectrum itself, which no component is trying to describe, so a share of it
    says nothing about the model. The headline number is the RMS of the residual
    against the RMS of that median-subtracted cube.

    DO NOT read these bars against a single-frame PCA's.
    Neither half of the fraction is the same quantity. The numerator here is
    `block_power`, a component's own weighted power, which that pipeline used
    only to *rank* components; the bars it plotted were the incremental chi2
    removed when a component is added on top of the previous ones. The two agree
    only when the coefficients are weighted-uncorrelated, which they are not.

    """Per-spectrum 1-sigma errors on the coefficients, two flavours.

    The coefficient step is a weighted least squares, so under "the weights are
    inverse variances" the covariance of c_n is just the inverse of the normal
    matrix already formed in joint_coeffs:

        Cov(c_n) = (B_n^T W_n B_n)^-1 = A_n^-1

    That is `sigma_formal`. It is optimistic for two reasons, so a second column
    is reported alongside it:

    1. The weights are NOT purely inverse variances. The telluric ramp of 2.3 and
       the soft clip of 11.14 both multiply w by a distrust factor. The clip is
       self-consistent (it *is* a variance inflation, by construction), the ramp
       is not.
    2. The noise model of 2.2 is reconstructed rather than read -- APERO's eflux
       column is all zeros -- so its absolute normalisation is only as good as
       the header SNR it was tied to. Measured residual/sigma is 1.07, not 1.00.

    `sigma_scaled` multiplies by sqrt(chi2_red) per spectrum, the standard fix,
    which absorbs both. Use it.

    With `exposure` given the covariance is formed on the summed normal matrix
    of the group, and chi2_red on the group's pooled residual and pooled degrees
    of freedom, matching the tied solve in joint_coeffs. Inverting one row's
    normal matrix while the coefficient was fitted to two would overstate the
    error by roughly sqrt(2).

    **Neither includes the uncertainty in P and Q.** The bases are estimated from
    the same 764 spectra, and these errors are conditional on them being exactly
    right. Getting that honestly needs a bootstrap over spectra, refitting the
    bases each time. Expect these to be underestimates.
