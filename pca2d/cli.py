"""The one command.

    pca2d-preclean --object TOI-2120

That is the whole interface. The object names a folder under the input root,
the instrument is read from the INSTRUME keyword of the files there, and
`config.yaml` supplies everything else in three layers: what is general, what
belongs to that spectrograph, and what belongs to that target.

Two roots, both in the config and both overridable for one run:

    input.directory    read from <root>/<object>/, never written to
    output.directory   written to <root>/<object>/<M>-<N>/, never read from

Four stages, in order, each skippable and each announcing how long it took:

    cube      the spectra registered onto one log-uniform grid
    fit       the two-frame decomposition, star frame and observer frame
    figures   one multipage PDF, parameters first, then every plot
    correct   the observer block divided out, written as t.fits
    lbl       both sets of spectra handed to LBL, delivered and corrected, as
              two objects in one tree. Prepared by default and run when asked.

Nothing is silent. A run takes tens of minutes and the difference between a
working one and a wedged one has to be visible from across the room.
