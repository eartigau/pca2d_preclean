"""Everything a run produced, as ONE multipage PDF.

Scattering forty PDFs across three directories makes them hard to look at in
order, hard to send, and easy to compare across runs by accident: two files
with the same name in two directories are one careless click apart. A run now
leaves one document.

It opens with what was actually run, not what a config file says today: the
resolved parameters, after the package defaults are merged in, as plain
selectable text you can copy back into a YAML. Then the figures, grouped, with
PDF bookmarks so the sections are one click away.

The individual figures are built into a temporary directory and removed once
they are bound in. Pass --keep to leave them.
