"""Every step from the file to the corrected spectrum, on one page per window.

The other figures each show one stage. This shows the chain, in the order the
pipeline applies it, on the same rows and the same wavelength axis, so that
what each stage removed is the difference between two panels the eye can put
side by side.

    1  the high pass: ln(f) minus a Savitzky-Golay of ln(f), and nothing else
    2  the reconstruction: both blocks and the observer frame's parity mean
       (and the star frame's too, under --mean iterate)
    3  minus the OBSERVER block: what a corrected file holds
    4  minus the STAR block: everything that is not the star
    5  minus everything: what nobody explained

Panel 3 is the product. The correction removes the observer block, its mean
per parity included, and nothing else: the star block, its own per-parity mean
and components, is the spectrum LBL is about to measure.

Everything is in the STAR'S rest frame with the rows ordered by barycentric
velocity, so a stellar feature is vertical and anything anchored to the Earth
slants.
