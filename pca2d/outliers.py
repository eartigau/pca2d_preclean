"""Samples the model leaves unexplained, found and set to NaN.

What panel 5 of the report's sequence figure shows, the data less everything
the fit models (the star block, the observer block and the parity offset), is
noise where the model is right and something else where it is not: a cosmic
ray the MAD cut let through, a hot pixel, a sky residual. Against the noise
around it, measured where it is, a sample far outside that noise is not a
measurement of the star, and a corrected file is better without it.

    running_stats      the local median and robust sigma (1.4826 MAD) of each
                       row, in boxes as wide as the high pass (highpass.window)
    clip               NaN wherever a value is more than nsig of them away
    residual_outliers  the same on the fit's own residual, per exposure, as
                       the (even, odd) grid mask the correct stage applies

The corrected files take it through reconstruct's NaN mask, beside the samples
the fit gave no weight, when correct.nsig_cut is set in config.yaml; null
leaves every sample in.

A SAMPLE IS THE WRONG UNIT. One sample beyond 3 sigma is not an event: 0.27%
of pure noise is, and 1% of these residuals were, which is what asking for
correct.nsig_cut 3 threw away (2026-09-25). What is not noise is a run of
samples leaning the same way, a bump as wide as a line rather than a spike, so
the unit is the EXCURSION: every window from one sample up to
correct.excursion_elements resolution elements, each judged by the aggregate
significance of its sum,

    Z(w) = |sum of z over the window| / sqrt(V(w))

and flagged, with every sample in it, when Z is beyond correct.excursion_nsig.
Six sigma there is not six sigma on one sample: four samples at three sigma
each make six when the noise is independent, which is the point.

V(w) IS MEASURED, NEVER w. The grid oversamples the spectrograph on purpose
(0.5 km/s against a SPIRou pixel of 2.3 and a resolution element of 4.3), and
the Lanczos registration and the high pass correlate neighbours further, so
neighbouring samples are anything but independent and sqrt(w) would inflate
every excursion into a detection. The exact variance of a sum of w correlated
samples is

    V(w) = w + 2 * sum over k of (w - k) * rho_k

with rho_k the autocorrelation of the residual at lag k, measured on the run's
own cube by noise_correlation. On TOI-2120 (SPIRou, 0.5 km/s) rho_1 is about
0.9, so V(17) is near 90 rather than 17: a window of two resolution elements
holds about three independent measurements, not seventeen.

    window_variance     V(w) from the measured rho
    noise_correlation   rho_k of the residual, from the cube and the fit
    excursions          the mask of every window whose Z is beyond the threshold

ONE COLUMN, ACROSS THE EXPOSURES. The same z also says, column by column in
the OBSERVER's frame, how the exposures agree there. A column where too many
of them are flagged AND whose survivors still carry more variance than noise
is a column the model cannot describe in any exposure: a detector defect, a
telluric line the correction does not reach, a sky residual that stands still.
It goes for every exposure rather than for the few that happened to be caught.

    frac    the fraction of exposures flagged in that column, > correct.column_frac
    chi2    the reduced chi2 of the SURVIVORS, > correct.column_chi2

Both, not either. What each threshold means, measured rather than assumed
(scratchpad/null_chi2.py, 4096 columns of 321 rows of pure Gaussian noise, at
the 3 sigma per-sample clip): the survivors' reduced chi2 is 0.973, not 1,
because the clip takes the tails with it (expected_chi2 below is the closed
form). Its median over columns was 0.979 and its highest 1.271, so 1.5 is well
clear of noise. The clipped fraction reached 2.2% at most, so the 10% of
column_frac cannot be met by noise alone: it is what keeps a column with a
handful of genuinely bad exposures, whose survivors are clean, from being
thrown away whole.
