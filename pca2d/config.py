    PyYAML follows YAML 1.1, where digits separated by a colon are a number in

    `2450:0.5` as 147000.5. The windows in output.windows are written exactly
    that way, centre:width in nm, so three of the eight became numbers in the
    tens of thousands, landed outside the grid, and were skipped by the figure
    scripts without a word. Only the ones whose centre had a decimal point
    survived, because `1200.3:2` is not a base-60 pattern.

    Everything else is SafeLoader: the same ints, floats, booleans and nulls,
    so no other value in a config changes type.
