"""The velocities a run produced, added to that run's own report.

A run ends with LBL, and until now its velocities lived in an rdb somewhere
under lbl/lblrdb and were looked at by hand with `python -m pca2d.lblscan`.
That is the wrong way round: a correction is worth what it does to the
velocities, so the numbers belong in the document the run leaves behind, beside
the river plots that show what was subtracted. Every star of the run gets a
page, joint runs included, and when lbl.before was on (the delivered spectra
measured too) each page is the comparison rather than one curve on its own.

Appended to the report after the LBL stage, because that is when the rdb
exists; the report itself is bound at the figures stage, long before.
