"""Hand both sets of spectra to LBL, the uncorrected and the corrected.

The point of correcting a spectrum is the velocity that comes out of it, and
the only honest way to know whether the correction helped is to measure both.
So this stage never runs LBL on the corrected files alone. It sets up two
objects side by side in one LBL tree, from the same instrument profile:

    lbl/science/TOI-2120/               symlinks to the spectra as delivered
    lbl/science/TOI-2120_PCA2D_2-3v/    symlinks to what this package wrote

and LBL's own products then sit next to each other under the same names, so the
comparison that matters is two columns of one table rather than two runs
someone has to remember to line up.

The delivered spectra are measured against the template LBL builds from them.
The corrected ones are measured against the star as the fit sees it: its first
star component at its mean amplitude, in LBL's template format and written by
LBL's own writer (lbltemplate.py), so LBL's template step finds it in place and
has nothing to do. With two or more star components, the ones past the first
also go to LBL, as RESPROJ tables STRPCA2..N: LBL projects every line on them
the way it does on its DTEMP gradients, and the rdb gets each exposure's
amplitude along them.

Symlinks by default (lbl.link), not copies: a few hundred t.fits are a few
tens of gigabytes, they already exist twice (delivered and corrected), and a
third copy would buy nothing. A disk that cannot hold a link at all, exFAT as
the data disks here are, gets copies instead, and the run says so and how much
before it starts rather than failing at this stage after the fit (link_mode).
Nothing here writes into the input tree.

What it leaves beside the run's other outputs:

    lbl_config.yaml     LBL's configuration, in LBL's keys and LBL's spelling,
                        which `lbl_compute --config lbl_config.yaml` reads
    run_lbl.py          the wrap script, one runparams dict per object, the
                        dict LBL users know, ready to be read and run by hand
    star_template.fits  the fit's star template, copied from here to where
                        LBL looks for the corrected object's template

Running LBL takes hours, so the stage prepares by default and runs only when
asked: `lbl.run: true` in the config, or --run-lbl on the command line.

Which LBL runs it is `lbl.environment`: a conda environment by name, and
`lbl-rapide` by default, LBL's speed branch in an environment of its own
(FAST_RECIPE). `current` is the LBL installed beside this package by
environment.yml, which is what every run used until 2026-09-18. The template
writer and the profile check still use that one, in this process: they read
and write files, and the speed branch changed neither format.
